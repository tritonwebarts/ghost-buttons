	I hope you enjoy these simple little buttons! They are in differnt colors, sizes, and in nav menu form.
	
	Use: Include this file into your project, or coy/paste the code below into your CSS. Add the proper classes to your HTML elements, and voila!
				These classes were written to be added to button, a, and li elements primarily.
				
				To see specific examples of their use, open the demo.html file in your favorite text editor.
				
				To have basic black buttons, only the .gb class is needed. It does not need to be added if you want different sizes or colors. For example, if you want a small, green button, you would wite the HTML as <button class="gb-small gb-green">Small Green Button</button>
				
	Use of this software is at your own risk and is provided AS IS. There is no intended nor implied warranty for the use of this work.
